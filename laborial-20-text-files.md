# Laborial-20

**Topic: working with text files**

## Trick or Treat!

The file `laborial-20-trick-or-treat.txt` contains counts of numbers of trick or treaters for 100 households over one Halloween night. Each line in the file contains a single integer.

## step-01: extract file data into a list

Write a Python function that takes in the name of a file with trick or treater data and returns that data as a **list of integers**. 

Remember, to read from a file, we need to:
   1. Open the file object
      > _Remember that the file path is relative to your **current working directory**_
   2. Read the file and do processing
   3. Close the file object

Test your function out by calling it with the data file you've been given. Do you see the results you expect?

## step-02: work with the data

Now that you have the list of trick-or-treat data, you can do all sorts of things with that data. 

Create well-named functions that take in the list from step-01 and returns:
   1. The **highest** number of trick-or-treaters
   2. The **average** number of trick-or-treaters
   3. The number of households with **over 100** trick-or-treaters
   4. The number of households with **exactly 21** trick-or-treaters

You should try to get at least **two** of these functions done during the lab.

_Each of these functions will look similar with an **accumulator loop**. For the purposes of this exercise, do not use Python's built-in functions or methods like `max`, `count`, or `sum`! Build those coding muscles._

## step-03: ponder error handling

## Error handling
The following errors are commonly encountered with file input. Think about how you might approach dealing with these issues.

1. Open `trick_or_treaters.txt` in a text editor and add an **empty line** somewhere in the middle. Fix your function call so that it loading the appropriate file. What happens? How would you handle this error?
1. Now, modify one of the lines of `trick_or_treaters.txt` so that it has a `float` instead of an `int` (e.g. change `30` to `30.0`). What kind of error occurs this time? How would you deal with it?
1. Finally, modify `trick_or_treaters.txt` so that it has **two numbers** on one line. What kind of error happens this time? How would you handle this unexpected input?
